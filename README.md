# SheikahSlateSimulator
A Simple app buildt in Android Studio. The app imitates the menu system displayed on the Sheikah Slate in the game Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild.  
Essentially, the app is a glorified soundboard that uses sensors on the mobile device to pitch-shift the audio for some of the effects.
This app is was used for a cosplay of the main character Link from the game.
In the costume, an android tablet with this app on it slides into a prop to make it interactive. A bluetooth speaker is carried in another part of the costume, and connected to the tablet to play the sound effects loud and proud.
